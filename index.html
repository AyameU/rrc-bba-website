                <p>The BBA of Red River College is dedicated to making connections between members, students, faculty and industry professionals. BBA was created out of a need for students to gain work experience and a competitive advantage in the tech industry as we enter the work force in our chosen field of IT. Though networking we maintain many volunteerism opportunities pertaining directly to technology; this allows students to build a resume/portfolio that doesnâ€™t just relate to, but is IT.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>The success of the BBA is depended on ACE student involvement. We are a completely student run organization and as such are responsible for ourselves. We work with students on projects like the RRC Solar-Panel and this website. These projects put you in touch with industry professionals and give you real working knowledge of technologies and systems used in the real world. These projects and others are the work of BBA's members making connections with faculty and industry.

                <p>The BBA is a team. As a team we have capabilities to accomplish things we could never do as individuals; be a part of something bigger, be apart of our team.&nbsp; </p>
