                    <h4>February News</h4>
                    <p>We have had an excellent start to the new semester and are very happy with the progress made so far.</p>
                    <p>February is a very busy month with events happening throughout. There will be many opportunities for volunteer work, so follow the updates on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/865544533563505/">Facebook Page </a>for early access to volunteer positions.</p> 
                	<p>We are sending several our members to the Disrupted Conference on the 1st and 2nd to fulfill various roles.</p>
                    <p>The Honour Roll reception is on Monday the 12th.</p>
                    <p>The following week is where things really begin to pick up. Reading Week starts on the 19th. That week also kicks off the ACE department 50th anniversary dinner.</p>
                    <p>We are also helping with the Tech Fair the college has planned that week for the open house. We will be needing lots of help for that event.</p>
                    <p>Mid-Term Exams run the week of the 26th</p>

                    <h4>Current Initiatives</h4>
                    <p>We are currently working on an update to our website where we will be starting our own <strong>Student Tech Blog</strong> past, present, and future BBA members are all encouraged to submit content to our multi contributor blog. More information on this as we get closer to launch.</p>
                    <p>We are also working on a YouTube channel to provide some How To: videos that will cover topics that fall outside of the curriculum.</p>
                    <p>We hope to have these up and running by the end of the month.</p>
