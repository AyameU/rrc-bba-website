                            <p>Hi! I'm Sarah! I'm a Term 2 BIT student. I'm interested in networking, security vulnerabilities and privacy. I love social media though. Go figure. My goals with the BBA are to increase awareness and engagement with students, faculty and alumni. Got an idea? Tell us about it! Get involved!<br>My experience to date include serving as Social Media Director for Canadian Cyber Defence Challenge for the 2013 and 2014 events, two years as writer and host of System Kidz, a weekly hour long talk show discussing issues happening in Manitoba's foster system on CKUW 95.9FM, and current work on Internet Safety John, part of Ed the Sock's Live From Canada. My hobbies include cooking, the gym, Netflix and Scotch.</p>

                            <p>I am a BIT term 1 student who’s trying to get the most out of what Red River has to offer. My goal in joining the Bits and Bytes Association board is to help build the community of students in the BIT/BTM/iBIT programs, whether that be through social gatherings, volunteering possibilities, or by making our opinions known to the faculty. I joined the Bits and Bytes Association because of the networking opportunities with other students and industry representatives. Though I am fairly new to student leadership, it’s a priority of mine to help the BBA grow. When you see me around, please approach me about the latest BBA activities, how you can get involved, or even if you just want to have a friendly conversation.</p>

I’m a term 1 student in the Business Technology Management program, where I’m working to enhance my 14+ years in retail and management with an IT skillset.

Outside of school I enjoy listening to and occasionally attempting to make music, hanging out with my dog and slaying internet dragons.</p>

                            <p>Hello, I’m Jordan! I’m a term 1 BIT student. I’m interested in building computers, programming, network security and privacy. My interest in computers started back in 2006 when I accidentally installed a rootkit on the family computer and tried for a few weeks to fix it… Oops! I decided to join BBA because I want to become more involved with the activities within the College, as well as network within the industry. My interests and hobbies outside of computers & school include watching hockey, playing soccer, golf, and binge watching the latest show on Netflix. If you see me around campus, don’t hesitate to say hello!</p>
