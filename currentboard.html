                            <p>Hello! My name is Tony and I am a second year student in the BIT program. My areas of focus are developing web applications and software design. I enjoy meeting new people and working with others to provide a better student experience at the college. Outside of school, I like to volunteer my time to organizations such as CanU, and to speak with school representatives on how to leverage technology into the K-12 curriculum.  I also love to eat a lot of food, especially wings and steak, and music has always been a passion of mine. I would love to hear your stories too, so come be a part of the Bits and Bytes Association and have some fun!</p>

                            <p>I am in my final term of the Business Information Technology program at Red River. I've taken more of a focus in programming for my final term, after getting experience working at Richardson Intl. for my co-op term. After having such a great time at Red River, making many good friends, and realizing how helpful the program has been towards starting my career, I have decided to become a lot more active in the BBA. When I'm not at school, youâ€™ll be able to find me playing Magic: The Gathering, League of Legends, or just jamming out on my guitar. I also attempt to be physically active, playing flag-football and slo-pitch throughout the year.</p>

Just for fun, lately, trying to create an own x86_64 operating system, in assembly language, and an own microprocessor using only discrete components or a FPGA.

                            <p>I am a term 6 student specializing in Networking and Web Development. In term 3 I worked with Tara Brown to come up with an idea for a student run association. I started the BBA because I wanted to help students get more out of the program; whether it be volunteering experience, meetings with instructors or communicating with students from other terms. Outside of school I work on a variety of coding projects and play on multiple sports teams. Skol Vikings, Go Flames</p>
