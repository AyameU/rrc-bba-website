                    <h4>Stack Overflow is Bad, and You Should Feel Bad</h4>
                        <p>It’s actually not all bad, but I’ll get to that later</p>
                        <p>I’m a term 2 BIT student. As a disclaimer, I am far from being an authority on anything development related. What I can do is share my experiences and opinions on things I come across as a student. Today it’s my opinion on Stack Overflow. </p>
                        <p>There are 2 kinds of new developers. It is inevitable you will come across a new concept, or a method you aren’t familiar with. Dev #1 will write the issue they are having verbatim into Google, Dev #2 will look at the developer documentation. </p> 
                        <p>You want to be Dev#2. Why? Well, by searching the hive mind for answers (Stack Overflow), you can and will come across many situations that you should apply critical thinking to. If you are an inexperienced programmer, how are you to know what is good code or not? How many solutions will you need to look at, try applying, and then fail at before you come to the right conclusion? I don’t have this answer for you. But I can share a situation that happened to me today. </p>
                        <p>Let me preface this paragraph by saying I prefer to refer to MSDN for reference on c#, but I was being lazy. Right now, we are learning about Windows Forms in our programming class. There are tons of different elements to all the different form item’s and not all use the same syntax.</p>  
                        <p>I ran across an issue where I couldn't figure out how to set a window to bot be resizable. So I Googled the problem. The first result was a link to a question on Stack Overflow. This particular example was from 2010. I plugged in the code that was said to work in this exact situation, and it flat out did not work. I thought to myself, this happens every single time I don’t use MSDN. </p>
                        <p>So I went to MSDN, looked up the Form class, and ctrl+f’d the name of the property I was trying to implement. I found the syntax I was looking for in like 30 seconds. I plugged the code into my code file and it worked first try. It should be noted it was much more concise than the code that was offered up on my first Google search. </p>
                        <p>Coming back to my point, that its not all bad………. Critical thinking is a very important skill to develop. Especially in today’s daily bombardment of fake/bad media. I think that being able to look at code and decide whether is it fake or bad is a good skill to have. </p>
